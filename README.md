## About The Project

CityLearn is an open-source OpenAI Gym environment for research in demand response and smart grid energy management. It simulates building energy dynamics, enabling the development and testing of control strategies. This project uses CityLearn to assess modern RL algorithms (SAC, PPO, TD3) for complex energy optimization. By comparing these algorithms, we aim to highlight their effectiveness for efficiently managing building energy resources—cutting costs, reducing emissions, and enhancing grid stability—especially in dynamic environments where traditional methods may be insufficient, thereby contributing to more intelligent and adaptive urban energy systems.

The original objectives were:
- Build upon the **tutorial.ipynb** notebook from the official CityLearn repository, which implements the **SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)** algorithm.
- Extend it with additional advanced algorithms:
    - 🔁 **PPO** (Proximal Policy Optimization)  
    - 🎯 **TD3** (Twin Delayed DDPG)
- Analyze and **compare the performance** of these algorithms in terms of:
    - Reward
    - Stability
    - Learning Speed

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8.x
*   pip
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) to manage dependencies.

### ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git
- CUDA Toolkit (for GPU acceleration)

### 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CityLearnRL-Bioinformatica.git
   cd CityLearnRL-Bioinformatica
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   # Using venv
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   python -c "import gym, citylearn, stable_baselines3; print('All dependencies installed successfully!')"
   ```

### 🐳 Docker Support (Optional)

## 🔧 Usage

### 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Run the main notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/models/PPO_TD3_tutorial.ipynb
   ```

2. **Train a specific algorithm**
   ```python
   from stable_baselines3 import PPO
   from citylearn import CityLearnEnv
   
   # Initialize environment
   env = CityLearnEnv('data/citylearn_challenge_2022_phase_1/schema.json')
   
   # Initialize and train PPO agent
   model = PPO('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=1)
   model.learn(total_timesteps=100000)
   ```

### 📊 Monitoring Training

1. **TensorBoard Integration**
   ```bash
   tensorboard --logdir=notebooks/logs/
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:6006` in your browser

2. **Custom Callbacks**
   ```python
   from stable_baselines3.common.callbacks import EvalCallback
   
   eval_callback = EvalCallback(
       eval_env,
       best_model_save_path='./logs/best_model',
       log_path='./logs/results',
       eval_freq=1000,
       deterministic=True,
       render=False
   )
   ```

This project primarily uses Jupyter Notebooks for RL algorithm implementation and analysis.

**Running the Notebooks:**
*   `notebooks/tutorial.ipynb`: This is the original CityLearn tutorial notebook focusing on the SAC algorithm.
*   `notebooks/PPO_TD3_tutorial.ipynb`: This notebook contains the implementations and comparative analysis of PPO and TD3 algorithms, alongside SAC.
To run these, start Jupyter Lab from the root directory:
```bash
jupyter lab
```
Then, navigate to the `notebooks/models/` directory in the Jupyter interface and open the desired notebook.
Then, open the desired notebook and execute the cells.

**Generating Plots:**
Visualizations from saved results (e.g., CSV files in `notebooks/results/`) can be generated using the analysis script:
```bash
bash scripts/generate_plots.sh
```
This script processes data from `notebooks/results/` and saves plots in `notebooks/plots/`.

**Models and Results:**
*   **Saved Models:** Trained RL models are stored in `notebooks/models/` (e.g., `ppo_model_seed0.zip`).
*   **Raw Results:** CSV files containing logs and rewards data are saved in `notebooks/results/` (e.g., `log_PPO.csv`, `ppo_rewards_seed0.csv`).
*   **Plots:** Visualizations are found in `notebooks/plots/` (e.g., `combined_plot.png`, `PPO_reward_plot.png`, `TD3_reward_plot.png`).

All three algorithms demonstrate significant improvements in energy efficiency compared to baseline controllers. The exact metrics vary based on building characteristics and environmental conditions, but typical results show:

- 15-25% reduction in energy consumption
- 10-20% cost savings
